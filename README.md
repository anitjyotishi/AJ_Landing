# Data with AJ
This is a landing page for my code and my insights on data engineering. Here, I would be talking about all the data engineering portfolio projects that I am working on and the associated learnings and challenges. This essentially serves as a technical blog. I would also talk about non technical learnings that help me in growing as a developer and as a data engineer. I am also into Astrology and Martial Arts and these hobbies help me become a well rounded individual.

My favorite learning resources:
1. Python crash course by Eric Matthes - This is a superb book to learn and revise the concepts of Python
2. Corey Schaffer's YouTube channel - Another excellent resource to learn anything Python related
3. Python Programmer YouTube channel by Giles McMullen - A great channel to giv edirection to overall learning and becoming a good software developer and data engineer. It is this channel which made me rethink my approach to learn Python or everything in general. I learned that learning Python programming is generally hard and we should stick to one or two learning resources and devote time to them to learn things in a structured manner.
4. Datafluencers I keenly follow : Zach Wilson, Seattle Data Guy, Deepak Goyal
